          This app is for every Dad that loves telling jokes no matter how bad
          they are or no matter how many eye rolls they get. Have you ever run
          out of jokes -- well have no fear, we're here to help because we have
          a steady supply. You can add jokes to share with others and keep the
          list of Dad Jokes growing.
